      <h2 class = backgrounds> Backgrounds </h2>
        <p> Many students study abroad these days. In fact, more than 4 million students study abroad now in the world. <br> However, some of them leave their own countries without any clear purposes of their study abroad life. This is a quite big problem because having the concrete purpose is important to make the experience more worthful and meaningful for their future. We thought the main reasons of this problem as following. </p>
        <li> They could not decide an appropriate program when they decide a program. </li>
        <li> There are too many programs to find the best one. </li>
        <p> Therefore, we started to focus on offering study abroad programs having fairly clear purposes and goals.</p>
      <h2 class = purpose> Purpose of Our Programs </h2>
        <p> We are offering programs for university students who think to work globally after graduation. <br>The important outcome of those programs is to gain spefialized knowledges and practical job skills. <br> Although it may be possible to gain knowledges and skills themselves in New Zealand, you also need to learn how to get along with cultural differences to gain practical skills and knowledges to be an international worker. </p>
